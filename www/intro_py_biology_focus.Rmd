### Notes

I made each of the problems up: read the documentation, read Stack Overflow, Google, do anything to create a solution.You won't accidentally spoil the answer because there is no published answer.

Celebrate error messages: it means you're testing the boundaries of Python and being creative.

Include lots of comments to explain what your code is doing. It's a gift to anyone who reads your future code to have a comment to know your thought process, what the code is supposed to do, code weaknesses, and requirements for that code to run successfuly.

There isn't a "right" and "wrong" answer to each problem, per se. There are some very straightforward ways to solve these problems and some ways that are an avoidable hassle but technically work.

Create a new Google Colab notebook to have the answers to these practice problems.

### Strings: Section 1

#### 1.0 Describe a string in your own words, including some limitations of this type of data structure.

#### 1.1 Print the COVID genome.

```
# Hint: Make sure you run the below code to pull in the UCSC COVID genome into your Google Colab's stort-term memory.

pip install ucsc_genomes_downloader
from ucsc_genomes_downloader import Genome
covid = Genome("wuhCor1")

genome = covid["NC_045512v2"]
```

#### 1.2 Print the first 5 charecters in the COVID genome.

#### 1.3 Print the variable that contains the COVID test results list.

```
# The list is:

COVID_test_results = ["negative", "negative", "negative", "postitive", "negative", "positive", "negative"]
```

#### 1.4 Describe a list in your own words, including some limitations of this type of data structure.

### For loops: Section 2

#### Describe a for-loop in your own words, including the limitations of this programming tool.

#### 2.1 Pretend it's September 2021. Use a "for" loop to print each item in the COVID test results list, one test result at a time.

#### 2.2 Pretend it's Februrary 2020... use the for-loop you wrote above in Section 2.1, an if-statement, and a "break" statement to halt the for-loop as soon as you the loop finds a postive test result. For bonus points, include an outputted message to alert the reader of a "postive test result!!!!" upon the for-loop's iteration over a positive result.

#### 2.3 Pretend it's December 2022. Use a for-loop to iterative over all the test results. Use an if-statement to only print the result if the test has a positive result.

### Section 3: Integers

#### 3.0 Describe an integer in your own words.

#### 3.1 
##### 3.1.1 Use Python to calculate the quantity of people who were tested for COVID. (Hint: Find the length of the COVID_test_results list)

##### 3.1.2 Write this quantity be a variable titled "total_results". You will need to use this variable later.

#### 3.2 
##### 3.2.1 Use Python to print the quantity of people who tested positive for COVID. (Hint: Find the length of the COVID_test_results list)

#### 3.3 Convert an integer to a string use the numbers above in a sentence "out of 5 people, 3 people tested positive for COVID."

### Section 4: Floats

#### 4.1 Use Python to calculate a float of the (people who tested positive) / (total people tested)
