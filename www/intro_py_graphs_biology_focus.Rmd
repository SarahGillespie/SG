### Notes

To solve these problems, read Plotly documentation, Stack Overflow, and Google. It's an "open book" assignment.

Celebrate error messages: errors can be annoying but it means you're creatively testing the boundaries of Python.

Include excellent comments to explain your code. It's a relief to anyone who reads your future code to have a comment to know your thought process, what the code is supposed to do, code weaknesses, and requirements for that code to run successfuly.

Create a new Google Colab notebook to solve these practice problems. Attempt each problem on your own before asking for help. We will work together to solve these problems later, starting from wherever you got stuck. It's better to have tried and havea wrong answer than leave something blank.

### Section 1: Datawrangling basics

The example dataframe used in this section will be a guesstimate of the quanity of food that my cats eat each day.

#### Load in data: this section will explore different data structures. It's the "under the hood" of what makes Microsoft Excel or CSV files you will use later in these practice problems. 

```
# import pandas, the library that makes it easier to work with dataframes
import pandas as pd  
cats_lst = ["Ada Lovelace", "Quinn", "Eevee", "Cola", "Clem"]

# Calling DataFrame constructor on list  
cats_df = pd.DataFrame(cats_lst)  
print(cats_df)  

```
Comprehension question: what type of data structure is:
<br>
1. cats_df
<br>
2. cats_lst
<br>
3. the elements within the brackets? 
<br>

<div id="spoiler" style="display:none">

Answer:
<br>
1. cats_df is a dataframe.
<br>
2. cats_lst is a list.
<br>
3. the elements within the brackets are strings.

There are a number of naming conventions for variables, but the default naming convention in 2023 is to use the relevant data structure as a suffix. That way it's immediately evident to someone proofreading your code that the variable is a list/constant/etc.

Additionally, you probably noticed the underscores. Python uses "snake_case" to name variables: lowercase words and an underscore to separate words. That should be your default for Python variables until we come across a new data structure called "classes" that use UpperCamelCase for class names.

</div>

<button title="Click to show answer" type="button"
   onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=='none')
              {document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=''}
            else{document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display='none'}">
  Show/hide
</button>

#### Calculating summary statistics

```
import pandas as pd  
  
# Create a Dataframe from a set of lists 
cat_food_lists = {'cat': ['Ada', 'Quinn', 'Eevee', 'Cola', 'Ada', 'Quinn', 'Eevee', 'Ada', 'Quinn', 'Eevee'], 'quantity_in_grams': [310, 250, 200, 200, 295, 225, 210, 300, 230, 190], 'day': ['Sunday', 'Sunday', 'Sunday', 'Sunday', 'Monday', 'Monday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Tuesday', 'Tuesday']}  
  
# Create a DataFrame from the cat food data. This is called casting the dictionary as a dataframe.
cat_food_df = pd.DataFrame(cat_food_lists)  
  
# Print the output.  
print(cat_food_df) 

```

Communicate the cat food chomping results. 

Find and print the mean, median, minimum, and maxiumum of the "quantity_in_grams" column using pandas.

<div id="spoiler2" style="display:none">

Answer:
<br>
The long way:
<br>

```
cat_food_mean = cat_food_df["quantity_in_grams"].mean()
print(cat_food_mean)

cat_food_median = cat_food_df["quantity_in_grams"].median()
print(cat_food_mean)

cat_food_min = cat_food_df["quantity_in_grams"].min()
print(cat_food_min)

cat_food_max = cat_food_df["quantity_in_grams"].max()
print(cat_food_max)

```

The short way:
<br>
```
cat_food_agg_df = cat_food_df.agg(
{
"quantity_in_grams":["mean", "median", "min", "max"]
}
)

print(cat_food_agg_df)
```

</div>

<button title="Click to show answer" type="button"
   onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler2') .style.display=='none')
              {document.getElementById('spoiler2') .style.display=''}
            else{document.getElementById('spoiler2') .style.display='none'}">
  Show/hide
</button>


#### Challenge question: Grouping your data into categories.
It's great that we can find the overarching summary statistics, but what if we want to comapre or discover specific day or a specific cat's data?

Use pandas' "group by" method to find the mean food consumption for each cat and for each day.

#### Section 2: Graphing review and challenge

Create and sum a new column to create the line graph. 

Explain that that is an array - like a list of lists. Explain how it differs from a dictionary. 

Create a line graph of TOTAL dry food consuption over time.

Create a line graph separated out by cat.

Taking your graph you created in the previous question, 


### Section 2: Using open source data to find interesting trends

Load in an openBostondata or MA state data csv that is interesting to you! Data literacy is important especially with climate change. 


Find and communicate trends
Do a bar chart using a catagorical variable.


Are any variables a proxy variables for a variable that is not in the data set?
