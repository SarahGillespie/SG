### Build ethical and explainable algorithms:

[December 19, 2021: *Week-long teachable unit about creating ethical machine learning algorithms.* <br /> This unit contains one lab, two lectures, two groupwork worksheets, and assigned readings from foundational academic research in this field. By the end of the unit, students will be able to define algorithms' fairness goals and conduct mathematical analysis in R and Python to consider the trustworthiness of many common machine learning outputs.](https://github.com/SarahGillespie/Algorithm_Fairness_Teachable_Unit)
