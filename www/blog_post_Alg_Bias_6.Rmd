### Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning : using [this paper] to admire its linear algebra and multivariable calculus in action.

[good paper for its ideas]
This paper is an excellent example of a smorsberg of lower division math concepts in action in the machine learning application.

This contrasts with how often professors of these classes teach to a broad audience with many engineering majors. This paper frequently answers the "when will I use this?" question 

#### Calculus



#### Linear Algebra



#### Statistics


#### Conclusion
It's exciting to see this melody of fundamental mathematical concepts being used in one paper. This is a great bridge between concrete math concepts and "squishy" or subjective machine learning applications, like word categorizations with respect to gender.
