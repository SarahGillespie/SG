### [Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3278721.3278779) : using [this paper] to admire its linear algebra and multivariable calculus in action.

[good paper for its ideas]
This paper is an excellent example of a smorsberg of lower division math concepts in action in the machine learning application.

This contrasts with how often professors of these classes teach to a broad audience, such as having a calculus class have an engineering focus or an introductory statistics class have an economics focus. I appreciate that this paper frequently answers the "when will I use this?" question with respect to machine learning applications and, as someone who has passed these classes, was a read full of poingent nostolgia being reminded of linear algebra transformations and type errors.


#### Calculus

Gradients
"We begin with a model, which we call the predictor, trained to accomplish the task of predicting Y given X . As in Figure 1, we assume that the model is trained by attempting to modify weights W to minimize some loss LP (yË†,y), using a gradient-based method such as stochastic gradient descent." (3 Adversarial Debiasing)


#### Linear Algebra

"If the output variable Y is discrete, a predictor Y_HAT satisfied *equality of opportunity* with respect to a class *y* if Y_HAT and Z are independent conditioned on Y = *y*." (1 Introduction, definition 3)


#### Statistics

Type I and Type II errors
"We also compare with the related previous work of Beutel et al. [2], and find we are able to better equalize the differences between the two groups, measured by both False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate (1 - True Positive Rate), although note that the previous work performs better overall for False Negative Rate." (1 Introduction)


#### Conclusion
It's exciting to see this melody of fundamental mathematical concepts being used in one paper. This is a great bridge between concrete math concepts and "squishy" or subjective machine learning applications, like word categorizations with respect to gender.

This paper also links in some multidiciplinary concepts as well, such as philosophy when describing the fairness definitions. (1 Intrduction, Definitions 1 to 3).
