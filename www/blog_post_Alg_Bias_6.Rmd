#### Introduction

[Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3278721.3278779) is an excellent example of the smorsberg of lower division math concepts used frequently in machine learning. The concepts can be grouped into calculus, linear algebra, and statistics.

While the paper assumes the reader is fluent in the introductory math concepts described, it is an excellent example of the application of these lower division concepts specifically within the context of machine learning. This contrasts with how professors of Introductory Statistics, Calculus I-III, and Linear Algebra classes are often taught to a broad audience of students needing a smattering of different math concepts for their career, such as a room of both economics, biology, and engineering majors. A [Wine and Viticulture major](https://wvit.calpoly.edu) was seated to my left in my Cal Poly San Luis Obispo calculus class. I appreciate that this paper frequently answers the "when will I use this?" question with respect to machine learning applications. As a bonus, this paper was a nostalgic read with linear algebra transformations and type errors reminding me of study groups I put together on weekends at Smith College, arguing out proofs and getting covered in chalk dust.


#### Calculus

*Gradients*

> "We begin with a model, which we call the predictor, trained to accomplish the task of predicting Y given X . As in Figure 1, we assume that the model is trained by attempting to modify weights W to minimize some loss LP (yˆ,y), using a gradient-based method such as stochastic gradient descent." (Zhang et al., 2018, 3 Adversarial Debiasing)

[the introductory math concept's application context]

*Differentiability*

> "Let the predictor, the adversary, and their weights W, U be defined according to Section 3 LetLA(W,U)betheadver- sary’s loss, convex in U , concave in W ,4 and continuously differen- tiable everywhere." (Zhang et al., 2018, 5 Theoretical Guarantees, Proposition 1)

[the introductory math concept's application context]

*Vector addition and subtraction*

> "Figure 2: Diagram illustrating the gradients in Eqn. 1 and the relevance of the projection term projhд. Without the projection term, in the pictured scenario, the predictor would move in the direction labelled д + h in the diagram, which actually helps the adversary. With the projection term, the predictor will never move in a direction that helps the adversary." (ADD PHOTO) (Zhang et al., 2018, 3 Adversarial Debiasing, Figure 2)

*Multivariable Functions*

> y = σ(0.6u − 0.6r + 0.6)
(Zhang et al., 2018, 6 Experiments, Toy Experiments)

#### Linear Algebra

*Matrix transformations*

> (2 Related Work, Figure 1: The architecture of the adversarial network.)

*vector transformations and vector mapping*

> "We will suppose the adversary has loss term LA(z_HAT,z) and weights U." (3 Adversarial Debiasing)

> "Under certain conditions, we show that if the predictor converges, it must converge to a model that satisfies the desired fairness definition. Since the predictor also attempts to decrease the prediction loss LP , the predictor should still perform well on the target task." (Zhang et al., 2018, 4 Properties, Optimality)

[the introductory math concept's application context] Math concept behind loss and lossy is the linear algebra mapping. Ex. <a,b,c> to <a+b,c>.

*Concept of discerete*

> "If the output variable Y is discrete, a predictor Y_HAT satisfied *equality of opportunity* with respect to a class *y* if Y_HAT and Z are independent conditioned on Y = *y*." (Zhang et al., 2018, 1 Introduction, definition 3)

[the introductory math concept's application context]

*Bias Subspace*

> "It is worth noting that these word vectors computed from the original embeddings are never updated nor is there projection onto the bias subspace and therefore the original word embeddings are never modified. What is learned is a tranform from a biased embedding space to a debiased embedding space."
(Zhang et al., 2018, 6 Experiments, Word Embeddings)

*Double lined E*

(Zhang et al., 2018, 5 Theoretical Guarantees, Proposition 2)
The 𝔼
E
 means either Euclidean space, the expected value of a random variable, or a field in a tower of fields.

*Proofs*

#### Statistics

*Type I and Type II errors*

> "We also compare with the related previous work of Beutel et al. [2], and find we are able to better equalize the differences between the two groups, measured by both False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate (1 - True Positive Rate), although note that the previous work performs better overall for False Negative Rate." (Zhang et al., 2018, 1 Introduction)

[the introductory math concept's application context]

*Statistically Significant*

> "Although the values don’t exactly reach equality, neither dif- ference is statistically significant: a two-proportion two-tail large sample z-test yields p-values 0.25 for y = 0 and 0.62 for y = 1."
(Zhang et al., 2018, 6 Experiments, UCI Adult Dataset)

#### Conclusion
It's exciting to see this melody of fundamental mathematical concepts being used in one paper. This is a great bridge between concrete math concepts and "squishy" subjective machine learning applications, like word categorizations with respect to gender.

This paper also links in some multidiciplinary concepts as well, such as philosophy when describing the fairness definitions. (Zhang et al., 2018, 1 Introduction, Definitions 1 to 3).
