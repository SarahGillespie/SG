I am an undergraduate student double majoring in [quantitative economics](https://www.smith.edu/academics/economics) and [statistical and data sciences](https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistics). I will graduate from [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/) in January 2022. My hobbies this month include drinking too much iced coffee, improving Wikipedia pages and reading the American Library Association's [Top 10 Most Challenged Books of 2020](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10).
