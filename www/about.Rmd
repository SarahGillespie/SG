I am a recent [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/) graduate who studied [quantitative economics](https://www.smith.edu/academics/economics) and [statistical and data sciences](https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistics). My career goal is to analyze and synthesize complex data into concise, relevant, and engaging insights to facilitate data-driven decision making. I currently work as a metrologist and quality engineer at a biotech labratory in Cambridge, MA.

During undergrad, I was the president of my school's Statistical and Data Sciences club. I used this leadership opportunity to organize inclusive events to support beginner, intermediate, and advanced student skill-level learning and enthusiasm in data science and statistics. Topics include included Git, R Shiny, data communication, environmental data, and guest speakers. I continue this energy by running Diversity and Inclusion events while at work and writing my political representatives while at home.

My hobbies this month include adventuring Massachusetts via commuter rail and Dutch-style bike, advocating for more bike lanes, listening to The Great Courses' [The Black Death: The World's Most Devastating Plague](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-black-death-the-worlds-most-devastating-plague) audiobook from my public library.
